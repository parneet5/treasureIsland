# treasureIsland

This is a beginner-friendly, text-based adventure game written in Python where the player embarks on a quest to find hidden treasure. 
The player makes decisions at multiple checkpoints that influence the outcome of the game. Each decision point presents a new scenario, 
testing the player's choices in a branching storyline.

The game starts at a crossroad where the player chooses to go "left" or "right." Each choice leads to a new scenario.
If the player chooses correctly, they reach a lake and must decide whether to wait for a boat or swim across. After reaching the 
island, they pick one of three colored doors, each leading to a different ending.

This project is great for beginners learning how to use conditionals and user input in Python. It also helps understand basic flow 
control in a game-like format.
